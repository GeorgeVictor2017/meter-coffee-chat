# Meteor Chat

A simple demonstration of a chat application using Meteor and CoffeeScript

This is **not** production-ready in any way! I just created this to learn a bit more about meteor.
A lot of stuff does not work yet and there is a big chance that it never will. You can't add new channels and users are not removed upon leaving for example.
Also, this project is still based on Meteor 0.3.1 and thus does not even use Meteor's new allow/deny system.
